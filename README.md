# Creative front end

## Project Overview

This project is developed as part of the Resume System Trial Task for the internship selection process.
The goal of this module is to create a modern, interactive frontend interface that allows users to build and preview their resumes in real-time.

This forms the UI foundation of a larger Resume Ecosystem, which will later connect with backend APIs, databases, and AI modules for automatic updates based on user achievements.

## Objective

To design and implement a user-friendly Resume Builder interface using React and Tailwind CSS, where:

* Users can input their personal and professional details.

* The data instantly updates a live preview of their resume.

* The layout is clean, responsive, and ready for backend integration.


## Deployment

My project is live at:
