# Creative front end

## Project Overview

This project is developed as part of the Resume System Trial Task for the internship selection process.
The goal of this module is to create a modern, interactive frontend interface that allows users to build and preview their resumes in real-time.

* The layout is clean, responsive, and ready for backend integration.

## Features
